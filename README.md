# CA: Huffman Algorithm for compressing text files
## Introduction
This project is based on Huffman Algorithm, which compresses and decompresses text files
## Prerequisites
The project work on Python3 programming language. You will need to install python3 interpreter and create new virtual environment. To install Python3 follow the link below:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Installations
Install requirements:

`pip3 install bitstring`
## Project using
Before using the app you will need download some text file, in order to test the algorithm. You can find text books on https://www.gutenberg.org. For instance, http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/120 (in english), http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44339 (in finnish), http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49424 (in german). I also provided "Alice in Wonderland" book (in three different languages) in the same folder. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the project (using cd) and check that itâ€™s there (using ls). Then run the app using:

`$ python3 main.py`

You will see User Interface, where by inserting "1" you will be able to compress the file, by inserting "2" you will be able to decompress the file. If you press "1", you will need to insert the path or file (if a file in the folder as the main code). Don't forget to put .txt in the end. If you press "2", you will need to insert the path or file (if a file in the folder as the main code). Don't Forget to put .bin in the end.
